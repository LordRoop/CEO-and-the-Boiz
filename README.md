# GPT4 enhanced Google Patent Scraper / Analyzer

This Python program fetches and analyzes patent data based on user input. It comprises different sections that serve specific functionalities:

1. **Fetching Patent Data**: The program prompts users to input a search term. It retrieves patent information from Google Patents API based on the provided search term. It then displays available patents matching the search criteria for the user to choose from.

2. **Extracting Patent Details**: Once a patent is selected, the program extracts key information such as the patent's title, number, URL, abstract, description, and claims.

3. **Summarizing Patent Contents**: Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, the program generates summarized descriptions and claims for the chosen patent. It structures this information into main sections, providing a concise overview of the patent's content.

4. **Downloading Patent PDF**: Upon user request, the program attempts to download the full PDF file corresponding to the chosen patent from Google Patents.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a search term to fetch relevant patents.
3. Select a patent of interest by entering its corresponding number.
4. View the extracted patent details including the title, abstract, and description.
5. Analyze the summarized descriptions and claims generated by the program.
6. Optionally, download the full PDF of the chosen patent.

## Code Description

The Python code integrates several functionalities:

- Utilizes the Google Patents API to fetch patent data based on user search terms.
- Extracts and displays patent details like title, abstract, description, and claims.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to summarize the patent contents into structured sections.
- Allows users to download the full PDF of the chosen patent from Google Patents.

### Running the Program

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`requests`, `openai`, `bs4`). Run the Python file in a compatible environment (Python 3.x).

### Sample Execution

Provide a search term when prompted. Choose a patent by entering its corresponding number. Follow the on-screen instructions to view patent details, summaries, and optionally download the full PDF.

## Note

- Ensure a stable internet connection for fetching patent data and downloading the PDF.
